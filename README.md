## Installation and Dependencies
To use Genesis AI, you need to include the necessary libraries and dependencies. This code requires the following:
- `Trade.mqh` library
- `Indicators.mqh` library

Please ensure that these libraries are properly installed in your trading platform.

## Initialization
In the `OnInit()` function, you can add any necessary indicators and technical analysis methods required by the trading algorithm. This is where you can customize and configure the EA to suit your trading strategy.

## Expert Advisor Start Function
The `OnStart()` function is the main entry point of the EA. Here, the EA connects to the trading platform and broker using the `Connect()` method from the `CTrade` class. The main trading loop is then executed continuously while the `isRunning` flag is set to true.

Within the main trading loop, the EA performs the following actions:
1. Updates market data and performs real-time analysis.
2. Executes trades based on predefined rules and indicators.
3. Implements risk management features.
4. Adjusts the algorithm to current market realities.
5. Implements position sizing and money management capabilities.
6. Backtests the performance of the trading algorithm.
7. Handles errors and logs trading activities.
8. Sleeps for a certain duration before the next iteration.

Once the trading loop is finished, the EA disconnects from the trading platform and broker using the `Disconnect()` method from the `CTrade` class.

## Expert Advisor Deinitialization Function
In the `OnDeinit()` function, you can perform any necessary cleanup tasks, if any, before the EA is terminated. This is where you can release any resources, close files, or perform any other necessary actions.

Please note that this code is a sample and may need to be customized and optimized to fit your specific trading strategy and requirements.
